{"name":"Minecrift","tagline":"VR mod for Minecraft; specifically targetting Oculus Rift, but support for other tech","body":"#Minecrift Mod for Minecraft\r\n\r\nCurrent Version: 1.0 beta\r\n\r\nStellaArtois, mabrowning 2013\r\n\r\n##What is Minecrift?\r\n\r\nThe cheesy name apart, Minecrift attempts to update Minecraft to support the\r\nOculus Rift. Initially this means allowing head-tracking input and using the\r\ncorrect stereo rendering parameters for the Rift. We also are in the progress\r\nof supporting different control schemes and positional head tracking. Minecraft\r\nfor various control schemes. Minecrift is also meant as a kick up the arse to\r\nMojang, so that they can add official Oculus support in the near future. If and\r\nwhen Minecraft officially supports the Rift, Minecrift development might cease\r\n(unless they make a complete hash of it), but probably not.\r\nWith thanks to:\r\n\r\n- Palmer Luckey and his team for creating the Oculus Rift. The future is\r\n  finally here (well for some people anyway; mine hasn't arrived yet).\r\n- Markus \"Notch\" Persson for creating Minecraft. What has it grown into?\r\n- The team behind the MCP coders' pack, and the Minecraft community - why\r\n  Mojang bother obfuscating the source when you guys have done such a fantastic\r\n  job of de-obfuscating it is beyond me!\r\n- Powback for his initial work on the Java JNI wrapper to the SDK. Seeing this\r\n  inspired me to get off my arse and get modding. See\r\n  [this Reddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1c1vh0/java_wrapper_for_devs/)\r\n- shakesoda and Ben (and others?) at MTBS for creating the GLSL version of the\r\n  Oculus distortion shader.\r\n- The guys at Valve for giving some good advice on updating a game for VR.\r\n- @PyramidHead76 for building the MacOS libs, and toiling to produce the\r\n  installation guide!!\r\n- Brad Larson and his GPUImage library, for the Lanczos GLSL shader\r\n  implementation for the FSAA.\r\n- All the feedback and support of the folks in the MTBS3D forums!\r\n\r\n#Where to get it?\r\n\r\nWe make regular releases and update the MTBS3D forum thread when a release is \r\nready for general use. However, if you can't wait that long, we do have a \r\ncontinuous integration service generously provided by \r\n[CloudBees](http://www.cloudbees.com). \r\n\r\nClick the button below to go to our Jenkins page where you can download the\r\nlatest build hot-off-the-presses.\r\n\r\n[![Powered By CloudBees](http://www.cloudbees.com/sites/default/files/Button-Powered-by-CB.png)\r\n](https://minecraftvr.ci.cloudbees.com/job/minecrift/)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\n\r\nREQUIRES Minecraft 1.5.2 With [Optifine HD D3](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/249637-152-optifine-hd-d3-fps-boost-hd-textures-aa-af-and-much-more/)\r\n\r\n###Magic Launcher\r\n\r\nThe recommended way to install Minecrift is use the [magic\r\nlauncher](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/939149-launcher-magic-launcher-114-mods-options-profiles-news/),\r\nwhich is available for Windows, OSX, and Linux.\r\n\r\n- Download Optifine HD D3, but don't extract.\r\n- Extract the minecrift\\_1.0\\_beta.zip\r\n- Open the Magic Launcher.\r\n- Click the 'Setup' configuration button.\r\n- Create a new Configuration and call it \"minecrift\" (or whatever you prefer)\r\n- Add these zips, in order:\r\n  - OptiFine\\_1.5.2\\_HD\\_U\\_D3.zip \r\n  - JRift.jar \r\n  - SixenseJava.jar (if you have a Razer Hydra)\r\n  - minecrift\\_1.0\\_beta\\_classes.zip \r\n- Click 'Test' to make sure it works.\r\n- When satisfied, click 'OK' to Save the configuration.\r\n- From now on, just start Magic Launcher and use the \"minecrift\" configuration\r\n  to play!\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, you will need to [update LWJGL to the latest version](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/LWJGL). Older versions are unsupported.\r\n\r\n###Manual\r\n\r\nIt is possible to install Minecrift without using the Magic launcher, but this\r\nway hasn't been tested as well. Use the steps below according to your operating\r\nsystem. You'll still need to update LWJGL according to the tutorial linked above.\r\n\r\n###Windows\r\n\r\nMinecrift for Windows requires Vista or above and a graphics card & driver capable of at least OpenGL 3.3 support.\r\n\r\n- Download [Optifine HD D3](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/249637-152-optifine-hd-d3-fps-boost-hd-textures-aa-af-and-much-more/)\r\n- Change directory to %APPDATA%\\\\.minecraft\\bin\r\n- Open your minecraft.jar file using 7-zip, winzip etc. \r\n- Select all, and drag and drop in the *entire contents* of the\r\n  OptiFine\\_1.5.2\\_HD\\_U\\_D3.zip into the minecraft.jar.\r\n- Select all, and drag and drop in the *entire contents* of the\r\n  /minecrift\\_1.0\\_beta\\_classes.zip (but not the zip itself) from the Minecrift\r\n  zip into the minecraft.jar archive.\r\n- Select all, and drag and drop in the *entire contents* of the\r\n  /JRift.jar (but not the zip itself) from the Minecrift\r\n  zip into the minecraft.jar archive.\r\n- If you have a Razer Hydra and would like to use it, Select all, and drag and\r\n  drop in the *entire contents* of the /SixenseJava.jar (but not the zip\r\n  itself) from the Minecrift zip into the minecraft.jar archive.\r\n- Make sure to delete the META-INF folder in minecraft.jar. Close 7zip /\r\n  winzip.\r\n- *IMPORTANT* (but only required once). Install the Microsoft VS2012 C++\r\n  redists (both x86 and x64) from\r\n  [here](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/11/en-us/downloads/vc-redist#vc-redist)\r\n- Start up Minecraft and off you go. If you get a black screen on login, trying\r\n  running an admin command prompt, cd to your minecraft.exe dir and enter the\r\n  command \r\n>java -cp Minecraft.exe net.minecraft.LauncherFrame\r\nThis should allow any exceptions or errors on Minecraft startup to show up in\r\nthe console.\r\n\r\n###MacOS\r\n\r\nFollow the same steps for Windows, but use ~/Library/Application\r\nSupport/minecraft instead of <Path to %APPDATA%>\\\\.minecraft.\r\n- The VS2012 C++ redistribute is not required.\r\n\r\n###Linux\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow the same steps for MacOS, but use ~/.minecraft/ instead of\r\n~/Library/Application Support/minecraft.\r\n\r\n##Razer Hydra\r\nVersion 1.0 is the first to include full Razer Hydra support. If you have one, \r\ninclude SixenseJava.jar in your modlist to enable the functionality.\r\n - OrientationTracker: If you don't have an Oculus Rift, you can use the left\r\n   controler for head orientation (direction).\r\n - PositionTracker: This makes a huge immersion difference. The Hydra can feed\r\n   position data the game engine to allow you to look up, down, around corners,\r\n   squat, and generally move around. Use one or two controllers attached to\r\n   your head and adjust the offsets from your eye center on the VR Options.\r\n - Controller: Use the right controller to turn the view left/right, move\r\n   forward and backwards, place blocks, mine, select item, jump, sneak, access\r\n   your inventory and navigate menus. The controls are currently hardcoded:\r\n - In game:\r\n   - Joystick X: Turn left/right\r\n   - Joystick Y: Move forward/back\r\n   - 1: Drop item\r\n   - 2: Jump\r\n   - 3: Select next left item (mousewheel up)\r\n   - 4: Select next right item (mousewheel down)\r\n   - JOYSTICK: Sneak\r\n   - Bumper: Place block/use item/interact (right mouse)\r\n   - Trigger: Mine block (left mouse)\r\n   - Start: Access Inventory\r\n\r\n -  In Menus/Inventories:\r\n   - Joystick: mouse up/down/left/right (don't use the actual mouse at\r\n\t\t\t   the same time: known issue)\r\n   - Trigger: Left Click\r\n   - Bumper: Right Click\r\n   - JOYSTICK: \"Shift\"\r\n\r\n - You should be able to take advantage of the new 1.5 inventory management\r\n\t controls with this joystick mapping.\r\n\r\nJoystick sensitivity can be set in VR Options.\r\n\r\n##Controls/Usage\r\n\r\nHere are some other hotkeys that allow quick access to changing VR settings.\r\n\r\n- All Minecrift settings are present in the Options->Minecrift screen, but\r\n  keyboard shortcuts are also available for convenience\r\n- Make sure to read the tool-tips on each setting in VR Options to get an\r\n  understanding for what it is adjusting. VR is best when you tune the experience\r\n  to your setup.\r\n- Pressing space-bar while in a menu will reset the orientation of the head tracker \r\n  to make the current direction \"forward\"\r\n\r\n- F1 to bring up the game HUD / overlay if it isn't already up. \r\n- Ctrl and - / = for IPD adjustment. Hold ALT as well for fine adjustment. The\r\n  IPD setting should be saved between sessions.\r\n- Ctrl O to attempt to reinitialise the Rift (including head tracking).\r\n- Ctrl P while not in a menu to turn distortion on / off. Sometimes useful if\r\n  the offset mouse pointer is a pain in the menus. Ctrl-Alt P to toggle\r\n  chromatic aberration correction.\r\n- Ctrl L toggles head-tracking ON/OFF. Ctrl-Alt L toggles tracking prediction\r\n  ON/OFF. It is OFF by default.\r\n- Ctrl U changes the HUD distance. Ctrl-Alt U changes the HUD scale. Ctrl-Alt Y\r\n  toggles opacity on the HUD.\r\n- Ctrl-M toggles rendering of the player's mask ON/OFF.\r\n- FOV adjustment within Minecraft will have no effect - I use the FOV as\r\n  calculated from within the Oculus SDK.\r\n- Allow user to use mouse pitch input as well as yaw. Use Ctrl-N to toggle.\r\n- Large or Auto GUI size recommended.\r\n- Use Ctrl-B to turn Full Scene Anti-aliasing (FSAA) on/off. Use Ctrl-Alt B to\r\n  cycle the FSAA renderscale. Be warned; this feature is a resource hog!! If\r\n  you cannot get 60fps at your desired FSAA level, cycle it to a lower scale\r\n  factor. Anyone with a nVidia GTX Titan please let me know what average FPS\r\n  you get at scale factor 4.0!\r\n- Ctrl , or . decreases or increases the FOV scale factor. This can be used to\r\n  fine tune FOV if it doesn't look quite right to you.\r\n- Ctrl-Alt , or . decreases or increases various sizes of distortion border.\r\n  This can be used to improve rendering speed, at a potential loss of FOV.\r\n- Ctrl V cycles through head track sensitivity multipliers. Try this at your\r\n  own risk!\r\n\r\n##Known Issues\r\n\r\n- FSAA (Super Sampling) doesn't work on OSX and is disabled.\r\n- Linux doesn't support Oculus Rift head tracker (yet).\r\n- A white line can sometimes be seen at the top or bottom edge of the HUD. No\r\n  known workaround.\r\n- When using both the joystick and the mouse to navigate menus, the cursor \r\n  does not respond to clicks where it appears. For now, only use one or the other.\r\n- Sometimes, the Hydra calibration text does not appear... if the hydra isn't \r\n  responding, try doing the calibration steps: point at base with left, click, \r\n  point at base with right, click.\r\n\r\n## Feedback, bug reporting\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease post feedback, bug reports etc. to the [GitHub issue\r\ntracker](https://github.com/mabrowning/minecrift/issues).
